* Must utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed
    * Crypto and express-session
* Must have a polished frontend / UI
* Must have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm
* Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
* Must protect API keys in node with environment variables.
